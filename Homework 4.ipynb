    "We first implement the (strict) LU factorization.  You can start from the Matlab code for Gaussian elimination given on page 75 of the Sauer text, reproduced below.  In the code below, `a` is an n by n square matrix provided as input, `b` is a vector, though we will not be using it for the LU factorization.\n",
